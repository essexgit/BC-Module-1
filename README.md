# Module 1, Challenge 1 for 2022 edX Boot Camps

## Description

- I wanted to make the best possible start to my EdX course, in particular learning GIT best practice.
- I built this project to learn basic IT team working skills.
- I have never been able to get professional feedback on my front end skills and this project has helped me gain confidence.
- I learned solving GIT and GIThub challenges, writing a ReadMe file, using Markdown and some tips and tricks for refactoring, spotting where code can be reduced by consolidation.

### HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor **accessibility** refactoring with semantic elements and alt text.

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
* Application's links all function correctly.
* Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
* Application's CSS file is properly commented.

* The resulting page should match the following image:
![Layout of finished page](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page has been provided but with `<div>` elements, which need to be converted into accessible semantic tags, plus descriptions added to the `<img>` tag using the `alt=""` attribute>.
